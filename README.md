# Known Errors
1. On the Homepage, when clicking on "Top Genres" or "Top Artists", the dynamically created table fails to retrieve the appropriate song names and/or artist names.
2. Clicking on the other categories will load the correct number of song names and artists, but will not create a hyperlink to their song details. 
3. After adding a song to the favorites, going to the favorites tab and hovering over a heart icon sometimes unloads the heart. The button still works as intended,
and refreshing the page usually reverts the change.
